# Math4330_Project

This project takes two vectors x,y in complex domain as it's input and uses a series of helper functions need to use modified Gram-Schmidt algorithm to compute QR factorization of A. It then uses back-substitution to solve get the coefficients of the degree 4 interpolating polynomial.
